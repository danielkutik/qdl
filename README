udev: QDL with NetworkManager and ModemManager
==============================================
On systems running NetworkManager and/or ModemManager the USB device
of id 05c6:9008 will be blocked by NetworkManager and/or ModemManager.

To avoid this we need to tell NetworkManager and ModemManager to ignore
the device by adding a rule to udev.
To do so, copy 99-qdl.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/.
